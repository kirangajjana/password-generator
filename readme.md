# Password Generator ðŸ”‘ ðŸ”‘ ðŸ”‘ 
- This is a simple Python script that generates a random password based on user specifications. The generated password includes a mix of letters (uppercase), numbers, and symbols..

## How it Works
- The script prompts the user to input the following:

- Number of characters (num_letters) they want in their password.
- Number of numbers (num_numbers) they want in their password.
- Number of symbols (num_symbols) they want in their password.
- Based on the user input, the script generates a password with a mix of characters, numbers, and symbols. It then shuffles the characters to - - - ensure randomness and combines them into a single string, which is the generated password.

# Usage
- Clone the repository to your local machine:

``` python
git clone https://github.com/your-username/password-generator.git
```

- Navigate to the directory containing the script:

```python
cd password-generator
```

- Run the script:

``` python
python password.py
```

- Follow the on-screen prompts to input the desired specifications for your password.

- The generated password will be displayed on the terminal.
